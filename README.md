# THIRD VISION FOR WOMEN USING AI AND IOT
## OVERVIEW
* In the following device we have implemented a voice recognition technique to turn on the device which then produces a non lethal shock to the atttacker in case the women faces trouble. 
* The GPS GSM technology implemented in the device is used to provide location status with Google map link to the relative and nearest police station.
Motion Sensor Camera is provided is implemented not only to detect criminal but also to prevent crime as the picture gets stored in SD card and also send   email to police department. 
* Vibration sensor is there to send the last location in case the device gets damaged. 
* Push Button (used for manual control)is used in case voice recognition module does not work ,the victim can activate the device by pressing the switch.
* Vibration motor  is used which vibrates for a window span of few seconds  in case the user turn on the device by mistake ,The user will get few seconds time to press terminal switch and thus prevent from creating un necessary chaos. 
* The terminal button which the user can press in case the device gets activated without proper intention. Terminal button will terminate the operation of the device immediately.
* AI  is implemented which provide us with crime prediction analysis. The following model is implemented with GUI app which allows only authorised person to access it and thus get detail information about  crime hotspot and live map location tracking. The police can compare victims location with the various crime predicted areas and thus efficiently track down the victim based on recent crime prone zones. Moreover, in this project we want to save the victim both by time and locality ensuring full safety.
# IOT 
* The motion sensor camera code is in----- motion and email.ino
* ALL the sensors integration with arduino mega to create a standalone device---Arduino mega integration.ino
# AI
* ALL the algorithm implemented along with GUI app is-----SHAKSHAM APP.py
# USERMANUAL
the dataset file(Westbengal crime(updated).xlsx)
*  User registration.xlsx file contains the user id and password for the app
* Analysis(Updated).text which contain detail analysis of WestBengal crime
